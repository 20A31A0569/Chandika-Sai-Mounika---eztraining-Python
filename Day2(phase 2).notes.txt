#Polymorphism:
One item or another item used for different purposes.
Types:
1.Overloading
  a.Operator overloading
  b.Method overloading
2.Overriding:If a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it will take it from its base class or parent class.

                       DATA STRUCTURES
--->HELPS TO WRITE EFFICIENT PROGRAMS
Linear(Storing data sequentially):Arrays,Linked Lists,Stack,Queue,Matrix
Non-Linear(sequence is not required):Binary Tree,Heap,Hash table,Graphs

***linked lists,graphs,trees***
CE
Static----arrays[size is constant and cannot be changed]
Dynamic----lists[size can be changed according to our requirement]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Linked List
ex:train
As the name says list of items which are linked with one and another is called linked list
Types:
1.Single or Singly linked list
2.Double or Doubly linked list
3.Circular linked list

Data-->Node(contains data and address)

CREATING LINKED LIST:
STEP1:Create the node
STEP2:Partition the node with 2 segments-->Data and none
STEP3:Add value into the blank node
STEP4.Mark the node as head
STEP5:Create the next node by following the above steps
STEP6:Establish link b/w 1st node and 2nd node

DISPLAYING LINKED LIST:
Traversal is required from first node till tail node inorder to display existing linked list.

OPERATIONS:
1.Insert
   ->Begining
   ->End
   ->Position
2.Delete
3.Search
